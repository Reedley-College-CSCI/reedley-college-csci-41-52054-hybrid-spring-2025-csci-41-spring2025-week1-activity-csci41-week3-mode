These are the files we used in Model 2 of Week 3 Class Activity. You can use the procedure demonstrated in the tutorial video on committing via Visual Studio 2022/19 or Code. 
Otherwise, download the files and make the following modifications to the SimpleVectorDemo.cpp file:

1. Modify the Code:

a. Create a New SimpleVector:
In addition to the SimpleVector of ints created on line 12, create a new SimpleVector of ints.
Name the new SimpleVector intTable2, and ensure it is the same size as intTable.
b. Update the Comment:
Update the comment on line 11 to indicate you are adding two SimpleVectors.
c. Modify the Loop:
Add a line in the for-loop where the values are stored in the SimpleVectors so that for intTable2, the values are count * 3 (instead of count * 2 as in intTable).
d. Display the Values in intTable2:
Add code to display the values in intTable2 after the lines that display the values in intTable.
You do not need to use the values in intTable2 for anything else (e.g., adding 5).

2. Commit Your Changes:

Once youâ€™ve made the changes, commit them directly to the repository.
Use a meaningful commit message like: "Added new SimpleVector (intTable2) and updated loop for storing and displaying values".

3. Submit Your Work:

Verify that your changes have been committed and pushed to the repository.
